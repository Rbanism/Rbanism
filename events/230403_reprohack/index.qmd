The Urbanism ReproHack is a hands-on event in which participants work in teams to reproduce a set of published papers and associated (open) data submitted by authors. The papers submitted for the Urbanism ReproHack include both R- and Python-based workflows. The Urbanism ReproHack is hosted on the [ReproHack Hub](https://www.reprohack.org/), where participants can also get further acquainted with the global research community concerned with reproducibility.
