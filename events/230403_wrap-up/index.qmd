The wrap-up event, open to the wider national and international urbanism research community, will (1) present the principles of reproducibility put forward in this fellowship, (2) announce the results of the challenge, and (3) share a data-informed synthesis of challenges an opportunities of reproducibility emerging from the challenge submissions. The latter is meant to inform the wider community about the learning process.

All material produced throughout the four stages of this process will be made openly available on the Rbanism website and will be archived on Zenodo for the long term.
