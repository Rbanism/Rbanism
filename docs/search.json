    "text": "Challenged by the limited awareness of state-of-the-art digital technologies, as well as the scarcity of scientific computing, data science, computational thinking and software management skills in the urbanism research community, this fellowship aims to empower researchers to use research software effectively and with confidence. The fellowship raises awareness, stimulates engagement and builds capacity by demonstrating the benefits of reproducibility, automation and scalability for urbanism research in two thematic workshops and two hands-on challenges—ReproHack and ScaleUp. Experiences from Carpentries workshops and synergies with other related activities carried out at TU Delft will benefit both the content of the planned activities and the community-building efforts of this fellowship. The fellowship builds on the first steps taken by a recently formed group of R users in the Department of Urbanism at TU Delft and it has the ambition to scale up to a larger national and international Rbanism community."

    "text": "3. Challenge\nThe challenge will be announced at the end of the ReproHack and will be open for one month. Individuals or teams can submit entries with their own reproducible research, together with a narrative self-assessment of the level of reproducibility and challenges involved. A two-tiered assessment process will be used to evaluate and rank the submissions: (1) a peer assessment in which participants evaluate another submission following a reproducibility checklist and evaluating the narrative self-assessment qualitatively; (2) after the entries have been ranked based on peer assessment, the top 10 entries will be evaluated in depth by an expert assessment committee consisting of at least three members. The first three entries will be awarded in the wrap-up event with vouchers and mentoring hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo do before the event:\n\n\nSet up a GitHub repository that can receive submissions\n\nPrepare evaluation guidelines\n\nPrepare the assessment questionnaire"
