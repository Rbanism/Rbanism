    "text": "Scalable GIS for Urbanists aims to introduce the infrastructure and workflows of large-scale GIS applications relevant for urbanism research. After a presentation of Big Geodata Science and a discussion on how it relates to urbanism research, the workshop will showcase two large-scale GIS applications in a tutorial format, namely a demonstration of the Remote-Sensing Deployable Analysis environmenT (RS-DAT) and a tutorial on how to run a scaled-up analysis with the Netherlands-wide 3D BAG dataset. Overall, the focus will be on challenges specific to the field of urbanism that cannot be solved with current approaches involving GUI-based software and data loaded in memory. The input will be given by representatives of the Centre of Expertise in Big Geodata Science (Faculty ITC, University of Twente), Netherlands eScience Center, and the 3D Geoinformation group from Delft Univeristy of Technology. Based on the knowledge gained from the introduction and the showcased projects, participants will learn to assemble a scaled-up workflow starting from a given case of small-scale GIS analysis.\nParticipants must have access to a computer with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.\nScalable GIS for Urbanists is open to all researchers in the Netherlands from the field of urbanism and related fields, including urban design, spatial planning, landscape architecture, and urban studies. You don’t need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.\nThis workshop is organised by TU Delft, Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Department of Urbanism, in collaboration with the TU Delft Library, and it is part of the Netherlands eScience Center fellowship project Rbanism, targeting digital competence in the urbanism research community."

    "text": "Our logo is the cornerstone of our identity, the primary visual element that defines and represents us. It serves as the essence of our community, Rbanism, which consists of dedicated urbanist researchers. We deliberately chose a generative logo to symbolize the dynamic nature of our field and the continuous innovation that defines our community. It reflects the ever-evolving landscape of urbanism and mirrors our commitment to fostering connections among our members through a diverse range of planned events. Moreover, the choice of a generative logo aligns with the individuality and diverse approaches within our community. Each member brings their unique perspective and utilizes the power of the R programming language, as well as other cutting-edge digital technologies, to enhance urban research. Our logo serves as a visual representation of this shared spirit of exploration and the synergies created through the fusion of expertise. In summary, our logo stands as the vital visual emblem that encapsulates the essence of Rbanism - a dynamic community of urbanist researchers continuously pushing the boundaries of knowledge and leveraging digital tools to enrich urban research."
