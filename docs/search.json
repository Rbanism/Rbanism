    "section": "",
    "text": "In our Geospatial Data Carpentry for Urbanism workshops, we often receive the question: why R and not QGIS? Answering this question is not straightforward (both are great), so I’ll try to do it by sharing a personal experience.\nRecently, Daniele Cannatella and I gave a QGIS workshop to around 70 MSc Urbanism students at TU Delft. It did not go well as we had to deal with unforeseen technical issues for most of the workshop. We updated the problematic tutorials after the workshop to make them more accessible and to overcome such issues in the future.\n\nWhile updating the QGIS tutorial, I also tried to reproduce the process in R: in a few lines of code and fewer steps.\n\n# Load packages ----\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\n\n# Read CLC data and EEA grid ----\nclc &lt;- st_read(\"data/CLC2018/CLC2018.shp\")\neea &lt;- st_read(\"data/FRAME_EEA.gpkg\")\n\n# Create new column with Level-1 code ----\nclc &lt;- clc |&gt; \n  mutate(Level1 = str_sub(Code_18, 1, 1))\n\n# Dissolve by Level-1 CLC class ----\n# Slow ~11 minutes\nclc_dissolved &lt;- clc |&gt; \n  group_by(Level1) |&gt; \n  summarise()\n\n# Intersect CLC and EEA grid ----\n# Slow ~15 minutes\nclc_in_grid &lt;- st_intersection(eea, clc_dissolved)\n\nclc_in_grid_area &lt;- clc_in_grid |&gt; \n  mutate(area = st_area(clc_in_grid))\n\n# Create centroids from intersection ----\nclc_in_grid_centroids &lt;- st_centroid(clc_in_grid_area)\n\n# Join dominant CLC classes to original grid ----\nclc_in_grid_final &lt;- eea |&gt; \n  select(geom) |&gt; \n  st_join(clc_in_grid_centroids) |&gt; \n  group_by(CellCode) |&gt; \n  top_n(1, area)\n\n# Visualise the result ----\nggplot(clc_in_grid_final) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = Level1))\n\nR felt so much simpler while QGIS felt like this:\n\nThis is not to say that QGIS is worse, but that its point-and-click approach works very differently from R’s code-based approach. As I see it, R takes you to the essence of the problem you want to solve without the distractions of a Graphical User Interface. Yes, it takes more time to learn, but you can get your GIS work done with it while being able to automate, scale and ensure that your workflow is reproducible by others."

    "text": "Why reproducibility, automation and scalability?\n\nReproducibility: Reproducibility is essential for result validation in urban research. By using the R programming language, it is possible to create a working environment where analysis results, models, and data processing can be easily reproduced by others or in the future. This is achieved by organizing and documenting source code, datasets used, and procedures adopted, enabling others to understand, verify, and replicate the same steps to obtain consistent results.\n\n\n\nThe Turing Way handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science - Guide for Reproducible Research\n\n\n\nAutomation: Automation allows for the automation of complex and repetitive processes in urban research. By using the R programming language, researchers can develop scripts and programs that automate data processing, visualization creation, and report generation. This saves valuable time for researchers and reduces human errors, improving overall research efficiency.\n\n\n\nlesson\n\n\n\nScalability: Scalability is crucial for addressing complex urban challenges that require processing large amounts of data. The R programming language provides tools and packages that allow for working with large datasets, distributing processing across computer clusters, and optimizing analysis performance. This enables researchers to tackle larger-scale challenges and achieve fast and efficient results in urban research.\n\n\n\nIntroduction: slides\n\n\n\n\nOverall, automation, reproducibility, and scalability, facilitated by digital skills like the R programming language, offer a range of benefits to urban research. Automation speeds up processes and reduces errors, reproducibility ensures result validity, and scalability allows for addressing complex challenges. The use of R as a programming language provides powerful tools to implement these key functionalities, improving the efficiency and accuracy of urban research and opening new opportunities for analysis and discovery."

    "title": "Libraries & Packages",
    "section": "",
    "text": "“BOXES” (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0) by ALA - The American Library Association\n\n\nlibrary() may be in the top most frequently used function calls in R. But what does it do? It makes tidyverse, here, sf and the like available in your code, right? However, this function call is described or perceived as “loading library x”, which is incorrect in two ways.\nFirst, the library() function does not make a “library” but a “package” available in your script. The function is called like that because it pulls a package from a location on your computer called “library”.\nIn fact, your computer may have multiple libraries visible to R in a hierarchical way. For instance, if you work with an active reproducible environment using renv, your code will search for packages called with library() in a local library specific to your project directory. This means that there may be multiple tidyverses or heres or sfs available on your computer. You can see which libraries are available (and searched for) on your computer with .libPaths().\nThe main cause of this confusion is the inconsistent use of the word “library” across languages. For instance, Python, refers to “libraries” in the sense of “packages”. While R’s terminology may contribute to this confusion, it’s still important to maintain precision in language.\nSecond, a package is not loaded but it is attached to a search path. This means that, in addition to being loaded to memory, its functions become available without the need for the :: operator. While this distinction may be less critical for everyday use, it becomes important when developing your own packages. For those interested, more details can be found in R Packages.\nConsistent use of terms is crucial for reducing confusion, especially for beginners. So, use “package” when referring to a piece of software that provides additional functionality, like tidyverse, and reserve “library” for the library() function itself or the directory where packages are stored."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this last part of the Reproducibility event series, individuals or teams can submit entries with their own reproducible research, together with a narrative self-assessment of the level of reproducibility and challenges involved. A two-tiered assessment process is used to evaluate and rank the submissions: (1) a peer assessment in which participants evaluate two other submissions following a reproducibility checklist and evaluating the narrative self-assessment qualitatively; (2) after the entries have been ranked based on peer assessment, the top 10 entries are evaluated in depth by an expert assessment committee consisting of at least three members. The first three entries will be awarded in an online wrap-up event."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The “Reproducible Research with R” workshop is meant to introduce the urbanism research community to the benefits, principles and craft of reproducible research. The workshop follows the Carpentries lesson “Reproducible Research with R”. Basic knowledge of R or other tools such as Python or the Shell is recommended for this workshop. Participants who previously followed a Data or Software Carpentry workshop, will have the required skills and knowledge. However, less experienced users are also welcome, as the workshop emphasizes the principles of reproducibility and can provide pointers for follow-up skills training."

    "title": "Scalable GIS for Urbanists Workshop",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Scalable GIS for Urbanists aims to introduce the infrastructure and workflows of large-scale GIS applications relevant for urbanism research. After a presentation of Big Geodata Science and a discussion on how it relates to urbanism research, the workshop will showcase two large-scale GIS applications in a tutorial format, namely a demonstration of the Remote-Sensing Deployable Analysis environmenT (RS-DAT) and a tutorial on how to run a scaled-up analysis with the Netherlands-wide 3D BAG dataset. Overall, the focus will be on challenges specific to the field of urbanism that cannot be solved with current approaches involving GUI-based software and data loaded in memory. The input will be given by representatives of the Centre of Expertise in Big Geodata Science (Faculty ITC, University of Twente), Netherlands eScience Center, and the 3D Geoinformation group from Delft Univeristy of Technology. Based on the knowledge gained from the introduction and the showcased projects, participants will learn to assemble a scaled-up workflow starting from a given case of small-scale GIS analysis.\nParticipants must have access to a computer with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.\nScalable GIS for Urbanists is open to all researchers in the Netherlands from the field of urbanism and related fields, including urban design, spatial planning, landscape architecture, and urban studies. You don’t need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.\nThis workshop is organised by TU Delft, Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Department of Urbanism, in collaboration with the TU Delft Library, and it is part of the Netherlands eScience Center fellowship project Rbanism, targeting digital competence in the urbanism research community.\n\n&gt; Links\n\nWorkshop program: link\nIntroduction: slides\nIntroduction to Big Geodata Insfrastricture, by Serkan Girgin: slides\nSURF infrastructure, by Natalie Danezi: slides\nTutorial 1 - Scaling up the analysis of urban form, by Lukas Beuster: repository\nTutorial 2 - Scaled-up network analysis using the RS DAT framework, by Francesco Nattino & Ou Ku: repository\nScale-up exercise in groups: assignments\nWrap-up: slides"

    "text": "Reproducibility: Reproducibility is essential for result validation in urban research. By using the R programming language, it is possible to create a working environment where analysis results, models, and data processing can be easily reproduced by others or in the future. This is achieved by organizing and documenting source code, datasets used, and procedures adopted, enabling others to understand, verify, and replicate the same steps to obtain consistent results.\n\n\n\nThe Turing Way handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science - Guide for Reproducible Research\n\n\n\nAutomation: Automation allows for the automation of complex and repetitive processes in urban research. By using the R programming language, researchers can develop scripts and programs that automate data processing, visualization creation, and report generation. This saves valuable time for researchers and reduces human errors, improving overall research efficiency.\n\n\n\nlesson\n\n\n\nScalability: Scalability is crucial for addressing complex urban challenges that require processing large amounts of data. The R programming language provides tools and packages that allow for working with large datasets, distributing processing across computer clusters, and optimizing analysis performance. This enables researchers to tackle larger-scale challenges and achieve fast and efficient results in urban research.\n\n\n\nIntroduction: slides\n\n\n\n\nOverall, automation, reproducibility, and scalability, facilitated by digital skills like the R programming language, offer a range of benefits to urban research. Automation speeds up processes and reduces errors, reproducibility ensures result validity, and scalability allows for addressing complex challenges. The use of R as a programming language provides powerful tools to implement these key functionalities, improving the efficiency and accuracy of urban research and opening new opportunities for analysis and discovery."
