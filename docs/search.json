    "text": "The Rbanism community aims to empower urbanism researchers, students, educators and practitioners to use open-source software and related open-science practices effectively and with confidence. It raises awareness, stimulates engagement and builds capacity by demonstrating the benefits of reproducibility, automation and scalability for urbanism research, education and practice. The community is initiated by a group of R users in the Department of Urbanism at TU Delft, and it has the ambition to scale up to a larger national and international Rbanism community.\nOur mission is to build and sustain digital competence and skills for reproducibility, automation and scalability, in the urbanism research and education community. We cultivate scientific computing, data science, computational thinking and software management skills, through peer exchange in a growing network. To that end, our activities include workshops, many of which are carried out as part of the Carpentries, hackathons and challenges, as well as various community gatherings. We organise both offline and online events to ensure the exchange of knowledge and experiences with our international community members. These various forms of engagement follow our commitment to inclusion and accessibility.\nThe Rbanism community was started by the Rbanism fellowship project funded by the Netherlands eScience Center and with support from the Mainstreaming Open Science Fund of the Open Science Community Delft. We work closely together with the TU Delft Department of Urbanism, TU Delft Digital Competence Center, TU Delft Library Research Data Services, the TU Delft R Café, Open Science Community Delft and Netherlands eScience Center in our awareness-raising, capacity- and community-building efforts."

Rbanism can bring experiences from Carpentries workshops and synergies with other activities carried out at TU Delft to benefit both the content of the planned activities and the community-building efforts of this fellowship."

We recognize a shared responsibility to create and maintain that environment for the benefit of all. Some behaviors, therefore, are specifically prohibited:\n\nDiscriminating, racist, intimidating, harassing, lewd, demeaning, bullying, stalking, or threatening speech or actions\nAny real or implied threat of physical harm\nUnwelcome sexual attention\nUnwelcome physical contact\nSustained disruption of speakers or events (verbally or physically)\nRetaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or other unacceptable behaviors\nRetaliation against an individual for participating in the investigation of a report of harassment or other unacceptable behaviors\nAdvocating or encouraging any of the above behaviors\nFalsely reporting harassment or other unacceptable behaviors.\n\nCritical examination of beliefs and viewpoints does not, by itself, constitute hostile conduct or harassment. Similarly, use of sexual imagery or language in the context of a professional discussion might not constitute hostile conduct or harassment if necessary to the topic of discussion.\n\n\nIf someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, or if you believe a harassment problem exists, please report it as soon as possible to the enforcer of this Code of Conduct, Claudiu Forgaci, either in person or electronically (with the option to remain anonymous). If the person you should report to is the target of the complaint, you may contact the TU Delft External Confidential Advisor. The target of the complaint will not be involved in handling or resolving the incident. Every code of conduct violation report will be treated with seriousness and care.\n\n\n\nParticipants who are asked to stop any unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately. Community Coordinator(s) and event organizers retain the right to take appropriate actions, including: (i) mediation between complainant and alleged perpetrator(s), to reach an amicable resolution; (ii) issue a verbal warning; (iii) expel the offender(s) from the event (particularly if a participant’s immediate safety is threatened); and/or, (iv) exp the offender(s) from the Rbanism community. Community Coordinator(s) and event organizers will also discuss with the complainant whether they wish to contact the confidential advisor(s) at the affiliated University. The alleged perpetrator(s) will be notified of a complaint as soon as possible, and be given a chance to respond to the complaint."

    "text": "Scalable GIS for Urbanists aims to introduce the infrastructure and workflows of large-scale GIS applications relevant for urbanism research. After a presentation of Big Geodata Science and a discussion on how it relates to urbanism research, the workshop will showcase two large-scale GIS applications in a tutorial format, namely a demonstration of the Remote-Sensing Deployable Analysis environmenT (RS-DAT) and a tutorial on how to run a scaled-up analysis with the Netherlands-wide 3D BAG dataset. Overall, the focus will be on challenges specific to the field of urbanism that cannot be solved with current approaches involving GUI-based software and data loaded in memory. The input will be given by representatives of the Centre of Expertise in Big Geodata Science (Faculty ITC, University of Twente), Netherlands eScience Center, and the 3D Geoinformation group from Delft Univeristy of Technology. Based on the knowledge gained from the introduction and the showcased projects, participants will learn to assemble a scaled-up workflow starting from a given case of small-scale GIS analysis.\nParticipants must have access to a computer with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on.\nScalable GIS for Urbanists is open to all researchers in the Netherlands from the field of urbanism and related fields, including urban design, spatial planning, landscape architecture, and urban studies. You don’t need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.\nThis workshop is organised by TU Delft, Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, Department of Urbanism, in collaboration with the TU Delft Library, and it is part of the Netherlands eScience Center fellowship project Rbanism, targeting digital competence in the urbanism research community."
