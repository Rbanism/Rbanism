The fellowship raises awareness, stimulates engagement and builds capacity by demonstrating the benefits of reproducibility, automation and scalability for urbanism research in two thematic workshops and two hands-on challenges—ReproHack and ScaleUp. Experiences from Carpentries workshops and synergies with other related activities carried out at TU Delft will benefit both the content of the planned activities and the community-building efforts of this fellowship. The fellowship builds on the first steps taken by a recently formed group of R users in the Department of Urbanism at TU Delft and it has the ambition to scale up to a larger national and international Rbanism community."

    "text": "1. Reproducible Research with R Workshop\n(Monday, 10 October, 9:00-17:00)\nThe “Reproducible Research with R” workshop is meant to introduce the urbanism research community to the benefits, principles and craft of reproducible research. The workshop follows the Carpentries lesson “Reproducible Research with R”. Basic knowledge of R or other tools such as Python or the Shell is recommended for this workshop. Participants who previously followed a Data or Software Carpentry workshop, will have the required skills and knowledge. However, less experienced users are also welcome, as the workshop emphasizes the principles of reproducibility and can provide pointers for follow-up skills training.\n\nIntroduction\n\nslides\n\n\n\nOrganisation\n\nslides\n\n\n\nAutomation\n\nlesson\nscript\n\n\n\nDocumentation\n\nslides\nR Markdown document\n\n\n\nDissemination\n\nslides\n\n\n\nWrap-up\n\nslides"

A selection of papers using R is desired, but the use of other tool sets (e.g., Python-based) will also be possible. The ReproHack will last 4 hours, in which teams will work together to reproduce a paper submitted by the authors for the ReproHack. The event will be hosted on the ReproHack Hub, where participants can also get further acquainted with the global research community concerned with reproducibility."

Challenge\n(25 October - 25 November)\nIn this last part of the Reproducibility event series, individuals or teams can submit entries with their own reproducible research, together with a narrative self-assessment of the level of reproducibility and challenges involved. A two-tiered assessment process is used to evaluate and rank the submissions: (1) a peer assessment in which participants evaluate two other submissions following a reproducibility checklist and evaluating the narrative self-assessment qualitatively; (2) after the entries have been ranked based on peer assessment, the top 10 entries are evaluated in depth by an expert assessment committee consisting of at least three members. The first three entries will be awarded in the wrap-up event with vouchers and mentoring hours."

The latter is meant to inform the wider community about the learning process.\nAll material produced throughout the four stages of this process will be made openly available on the Rbanism website and will be archived on Zenodo for the long term."
