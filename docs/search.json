    "text": "Challenged by the limited awareness of state-of-the-art digital technologies, as well as the scarcity of scientific computing, data science, computational thinking and software management skills in the urbanism research community, this fellowship aims to empower researchers to use research software effectively and with confidence. The fellowship raises awareness, stimulates engagement and builds capacity by demonstrating the benefits of reproducibility, automation and scalability for urbanism research in two thematic workshops and two hands-on challenges—ReproHack and ScaleUp. Experiences from Carpentries workshops and synergies with other related activities carried out at TU Delft will benefit both the content of the planned activities and the community-building efforts of this fellowship. The fellowship builds on the first steps taken by a recently formed group of R users in the Department of Urbanism at TU Delft and it has the ambition to scale up to a larger national and international Rbanism community."

    "text": "1. Reproducible Research with R Workshop\n(Monday, 10 October, 9:00-17:00)\nThe “Reproducible Research with R” workshop is meant to introduce the urbanism research community to the benefits, principles and craft of reproducible research. The workshop will follow the Carpentries lesson “Reproducible Research with R”. Basic knowledge of R or other tools such as Python or the Shell is recommended for this workshop. Participants who previously followed a Data or Software Carpentry workshop, will have the required skills and knowledge. However, less experienced users are also welcome, as the workshop emphasizes the principles of reproducibility and can provide pointers for follow-up skills training.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo do before the event:\n\n\nShorten the Carpentries lesson to a 1-day format\n\nWho will teach? (Claudiu, Barbara?)\n\nCheck with the TU Delft Graduate School if PhD candidates can get GS credits for joining the workshop\n\nDelegate registration infrastructure (Paula?)\n\nUse TU Delft infrastructure for catering and workshop facilities\n\nAdvertise and engage the community"

    "text": "2. ReproHack\n(Friday, 14 October, 13:00-17:00)\nBefore the ReproHack, a call for papers will be launched to select at least 10 papers and associated (open) data that will be made available to the participants. A selection of papers using R is desired, but the use of other tool sets (e.g., Python-based) will also be possible. The ReproHack will last 4 hours, in which teams will work together to reproduce a paper submitted by the authors for the ReproHack. The event will be hosted on the ReproHack Hub, where participants can also get further acquainted with the global research community concerned with reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo do before the event:\n\n\nRegister the event on the ReproHack Hub\n\nSelect papers in the ReproHack Hub submission system\n\nUse TU Delft infrastructure for catering and workshop facilities\n\nAnnounce the challenge in the community\n\nInvite a speaker from the ReproHack community (Daniela Gawehns, Anna Krystalli, or someone else from the ReproHack team) for an inspirational lecture"

    "text": "3. Challenge\nThe challenge will be announced at the end of the ReproHack and will be open for one month. Individuals or teams can submit entries with their own reproducible research, together with a narrative self-assessment of the level of reproducibility and challenges involved. A two-tiered assessment process will be used to evaluate and rank the submissions: (1) a peer assessment in which participants evaluate two other submissions following a reproducibility checklist and evaluating the narrative self-assessment qualitatively; (2) after the entries have been ranked based on peer assessment, the top 10 entries will be evaluated in depth by an expert assessment committee consisting of at least three members. The first three entries will be awarded in the wrap-up event with vouchers and mentoring hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo do before the event:\n\n\nSet up a GitHub repository that can receive submissions\n\nPrepare clear guidelines and goals for the challenge\n\nPrepare assessment guidelines and questionnaire\n\nFinalize the dates and workflow for final assessment (e.g., deadlines for submission, peer assessment, expert assessment)"
