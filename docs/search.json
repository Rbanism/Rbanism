    "text": "Rbanism is a Netherlands eScience Center fellowship project that aims to empower researchers to use research software effectively and with confidence. The fellowship raises awareness, stimulates engagement and builds capacity by demonstrating the benefits of reproducibility, automation and scalability for urbanism research in two thematic workshops, two hands-on challenges – ReproHack and ScaleUp – and two corresponding one-month challenges. The fellowship will build on the first steps taken by a recently formed group of R users in the Department of Urbanism at TU Delft and it has the ambition to scale up to a larger national and international Rbanism community."

    "section": "The why",
    "text": "The why\nThe urbanism research community is challenged by a limited awareness of state-of-the-art digital technologies, as well as the scarcity of scientific computing, data science, computational thinking and software management skills. Rbanism can bring experiences from Carpentries workshops and synergies with other activities carried out at TU Delft to benefit both the content of the planned activities and the community-building efforts of this fellowship."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this last part of the Reproducibility event series, individuals or teams can submit entries with their own reproducible research, together with a narrative self-assessment of the level of reproducibility and challenges involved. A two-tiered assessment process is used to evaluate and rank the submissions: (1) a peer assessment in which participants evaluate two other submissions following a reproducibility checklist and evaluating the narrative self-assessment qualitatively; (2) after the entries have been ranked based on peer assessment, the top 10 entries are evaluated in depth by an expert assessment committee consisting of at least three members. The first three entries will be awarded in the wrap-up event with vouchers and mentoring hours."

    "text": "The “Reproducible Research with R” workshop is meant to introduce the urbanism research community to the benefits, principles and craft of reproducible research. The workshop follows the Carpentries lesson “Reproducible Research with R”. Basic knowledge of R or other tools such as Python or the Shell is recommended for this workshop. Participants who previously followed a Data or Software Carpentry workshop, will have the required skills and knowledge. However, less experienced users are also welcome, as the workshop emphasizes the principles of reproducibility and can provide pointers for follow-up skills training."

    "text": "Before the ReproHack, a call for papers was launched to select papers and associated (open) data that will be made available to the participants. A selection of papers using R was not a requirement; the use of other (e.g., Python-based) tool sets was also possible. The Urbanism ReproHack lasted 4 hours, in which teams work together to reproduce a paper submitted by the authors. The event was hosted on the ReproHack Hub, where participants could also get further acquainted with the global research community concerned with reproducibility."

The latter is meant to inform the wider community about the learning process.\nAll material produced throughout the four stages of this process will be made openly available on the Rbanism website and will be archived on Zenodo for the long term."

The book does not teach R programming basics, nor does it cover statistics and visualisation. The language is accessible and non-academic, with multiple references to the pains encounters by data science practitioners due to the lack of reproducibility.\nGetting started with R Markdown (episode part of the R for Social Scientists Data Carpentry curriculum) - 1 hour\n\n\n\n\nFrom urbanism research\n\nGIS and Computational Notebooks\nEvolution of Urban Patterns: Urban Morphology as an Open Reproducible Data Science\nReproducible Graduate Theses in GIScience"
