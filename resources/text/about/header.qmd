The Rbanism community was started by the [Rbanism fellowship project](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/fellows/claudiu-forgaci/) funded by the Netherlands eScience Center and with support from the Mainstreaming Open Science Fund of the Open Science Community Delft. We work closely together with the [TU Delft Department of Urbanism](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/architecture-and-the-built-environment/about-the-faculty/departments/urbanism), [TU Delft Digital Competence Center](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/library-voor-onderzoekers/library-voor-onderzoekers/onderzoek-starten/dcc), [TU Delft Library Research Data Services](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/library-voor-onderzoekers/library-voor-onderzoekers/onderzoek-starten/dcc), the [TU Delft R Caf√©](https://delft-rcafe.github.io/home/Index.html), [Open Science Community Delft](https://osc-delft.github.io/) and [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/) in our awareness-raising, capacity- and community-building efforts.
