Before the ReproHack, a call for papers was launched to select papers and associated (open) data that will be made available to the participants. A selection of papers using R was not a requirement; the use of other (e.g., Python-based) tool sets was also possible. The Urbanism ReproHack lasted 4 hours, in which teams work together to reproduce a paper submitted by the authors. The event was hosted on the [ReproHack Hub](https://www.reprohack.org/), where participants could also get further acquainted with the global research community concerned with reproducibility.
