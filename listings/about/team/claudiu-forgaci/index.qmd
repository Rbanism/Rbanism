description: I am an architect and urbanist, currently engaged in understanding how spatial urbanisation patterns, at multiple scales, are related to urban resilience. In my research and practice, I combine urban design and planning, landscape architecture and architecture in a multi-scalar and social-ecological approach to urbanism.
