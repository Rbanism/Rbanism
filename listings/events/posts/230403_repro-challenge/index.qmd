In this last part of the Reproducibility event series, individuals or teams can submit entries with their own reproducible research, together with a narrative self-assessment of the level of reproducibility and challenges involved. A two-tiered assessment process is used to evaluate and rank the submissions: (1) a **peer assessment** in which participants evaluate two other submissions following a reproducibility checklist and evaluating the narrative self-assessment qualitatively; (2) after the entries have been ranked based on peer assessment, the top 10 entries are evaluated in depth by an **expert assessment committee** consisting of at least three members. The first three entries will be awarded in an online wrap-up event.
